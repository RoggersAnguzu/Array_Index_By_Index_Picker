# Array_Index_By_Index_Picker
Motivation
The "Array Analyzer" program is designed to provide a simple yet effective way to analyzean array of integers. It offers functionalities to find pairs of numbers that sum up to a specific value, as well as to determine the maximum and minimum values within the array. This program is intended to help users gain a better understanding of the relationships between elements in an array and extract key insights from their data.

Features
The "Array Analyzer" program provides the following features:

Sum Finder: This feature allows you to find pairs of numbers within an array that add up to a user-defined sum. The program iterates through the array, systematically checking all possible combinations to identify and display pairs with the desired sum.

Maximum and Minimum Value Calculator: This feature calculates and displays the maximum and minimum values present in the given array. It iterates through the array, comparing each element to the current maximum and minimum values, and updates these values accordingly.

Usage
Sum Finder:

Run the program and follow the prompts to input the number of elements in the array.
Enter each element one by one.
The program will then search for pairs of elements that add up to a specified sum, providing the indices and values of the pairs found.
If no such pairs are found, the program will indicate that no pair with the desired sum exists.
Maximum and Minimum Value Calculator:

Run the program and provide the number of elements in the array.
Input each element as prompted.
The program will determine the maximum and minimum values present in the array and display them.
How It Works
The program utilizes nested loops to efficiently analyze the array. For the sum finder feature, it checks all possible pairs of elements to identify those with the desired sum. For the maximum and minimum value calculator, it iterates through the array, comparing each element with the current maximum and minimum values.
